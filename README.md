# DREADSCAPE PROJECT
 Repository files for the game DreadScape - a game created in python using the pygame module
To download the game, just directly download the "DREADSCAPE" folder linked here, or zip the entire code to your system and unzip it to get the "DREADSCAPE" folder.

NOTE:
Most changes involving this project wasn't done on this GitHub repository directly, as most of the work was done through other non-code platforms like Google Drive and Discord, so this repository only includes the final files. For the sake of showing the project's history however, we have included the past builds of the game in the "OLD_FILES" folder
